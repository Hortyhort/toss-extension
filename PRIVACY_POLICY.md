**Last updated:** January 3, 2026

## Overview
Toss is a browser extension that helps you send selected text to AI assistants. Your privacy is important to us.

## What Toss Stores Locally
Toss stores the following data in your browser's local storage (never sent anywhere):
- Your most recent "toss" (the text you sent and which LLM you sent it to)
- Your auto-send preference
- These are only used to display "Last Toss" and your settings in the extension popup

Toss requires the following permissions:

- **contextMenus**: To add "Toss to..." to your right-click menu
