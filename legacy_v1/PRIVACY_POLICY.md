# Privacy Policy for Toss Extension

**Last Updated:** [Date]

The **Toss** extension ("we", "us", or "our") respects your privacy. This Privacy Policy describes how we handle information when you use our browser extension.

## 1. Information Collection and Use

**Toss** is a tool designed to process selected text and send it to your preferred Large Language Model (LLM) or productivity tools (e.g., Notion).

### a. User-Selected Content

We only access and process text that you explicitly select on a web page and choose to "Toss". This text is temporarily stored in your browser's local memory to facilitate the transfer to the target service (e.g., Claude, ChatGPT, Notion). We do not permanently store, analyze, or share this content.

### b. Google Search Results (Feature: "Google Search + Toss")

When you use the "Google Search + Toss" feature, the extension momentarily accesses search results on `google.com` to scrape the title, URL, and snippet of the top results. This data is combined with your original query and sent to your selected LLM. This process happens locally on your device. We do not collect or store your search history.

### c. Notion Integration

If you connect your Notion account, the extension stores your Notion Integration Token and Page ID locally in your browser (`chrome.storage.local`). This token is used solely to authenticate API requests to Notion that _you_ initiate. We do not have access to your Notion credentials or other data in your Notion workspace.

## 2. Data Storage

All user settings (e.g., API tokens, preferred templates, routing rules) are stored locally on your device using the Chrome Storage API. We do not maintain any external servers or databases to store user data.

## 3. Third-Party Services

Our extension interacts with the following third-party services at your request:

- **AI Providers** (Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, Perplexity, X): We open tabs or send data to these services based on your selection. Their use of your data is governed by their respective privacy policies.
- **Notion**: We send data to the Notion API to append blocks to your page. This interaction is governed by Notion's privacy policy.

## 4. Contact
